#### . The data above we have is the piece of information from the World Bank including the countries Bolivia, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Gutamala, Mexico, Uruguay from the year 2000 to 2015. It potrays that, in 2000 Eucador has the highest poverty rate with 27% where the average earning of citizen is $2.50 per day and Uruguay is holding the least percent of deprivation which is 2.09%

### Country Included:
#### Argentina
#### . The Labor Income Poverty Index (LIPI) measures poverty based on the share of households with less per-capita labor income than the regional poverty lines relative to the reference period.
#### Reference: LAC Equity Lab: Labor Markets - Labor Income Poverty Index (LIPI) - World Bank. https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/lac-equity-lab1/labor-markets/lipi
#### The above Bar Graph indicates that Argentina is the only country that holds the Labour Income Poverty Index, and the year considered is 2004.There was deprivation in the value from the year 2004 to the year 2014, making it clear that Argentina's poverty index value has decreased to almost half the original value.

### Multidimensional Poverty Headcount Ratio, Children(% of Population 0-17)

### Multidimensional headcount ratio :
#### This is the formal name for the “incidence” of poverty, i.e., the proportion of people (within a given population) who experience multiple deprivations.
#### Poverty incidence (PI)
#### The proportion of families/individuals with per capita income/expenditure less than the per capita poverty threshold to the total number of families/individuals
#### Reference: 1997 Philippine Poverty Statistics
#### Board Resolution: Resolution No. 2 - Series of 2007
#### approved: 2/14/2007
#### The graph depicts that among all the countries mentioned above, Angola covers maximum percentage of the headcount ratio with 6.55% and the least fraction covered is by Norway(1.6%). The year of Data presented is 2015.

### Multidimensional Poverty Headcount Ratio, Male(% of Male Population)
![newplot (12)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89939369/143145817-e7ff1cf9-b63f-43bb-9f0e-4efb9a9e3960.png)
#### The headcount ratio of male in the year 2015 is less when compared to the children. It shows that North Mecadonia has the highest rate of the ratio with 5.6% of the total.

### Multidimensional Poverty Headcount Ratio, Female(% of Female Population)
![newplot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89939369/143145902-ca00c7ae-f85f-4ca0-b4a7-357934e9d8bc.png)
#### The female poverty headcount ratio individually is high in Bulgaria with almost 88% with respect to the high value given in the data and least in Iceland.

### Multidimensional Poverty Index(Scale 0-1)
![newplot (14)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89939369/143145983-de7cb4c5-c76c-475d-b47f-6444fbd4f543.png)
### Countries Included:
#### Ecuador
#### Dominican Republic
#### Costa Rica
#### Angola

#### . The Data with the scale 0-1 included four countries where Angola covers maximum Percentage(43.5%) of the whole.
### CONCLUSION
#### . From the data chosen above, it can be concluded that whether considered in Multidimensional view or the individual context, poverty has always been in existence at least 2% overall. When the global Data is examined, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Liberia, Burundi, Niger, Ecuador, and Eritrea were the world's poorest countries, according to Global Finance Magazine. In addition to this, when the individual multi dimensional poverty index in taken into consideration, female percentage was almost 88% and the fraction gradually reduced by 2014.
