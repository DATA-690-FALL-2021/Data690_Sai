## What I learnt from the session:

### . To begin with, EZAnalytix can be used to cut down the complexity at the time of providing a code and convert the data into simplified manner by dragging and dropping.

### . With the chosen Data, it also allows to use Data processing techniques where we can use Data join which enables the option of selecting and joining either the same or the other dataset to the existing set.

### . Data Processing also allows to modify the chosen data and the specific variables where the data can be altered(improvised).

### . In addition to this, one of the important techniques of Data Processing is "Validation Rules" which again branched into four types with individual specilization.

### . Validation rules basically helps in validating/authenticating the correction of rules(Verification).

### . One sample distribution test is one of the methods that contains binomial, multinomial and few other tests which produces a constant outcome.
